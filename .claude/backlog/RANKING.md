# Why the order is what it is

Standing reasoning. Read on a re-rank, not on every claim.

## Current shape

**Effort 0009 — one skill per session — is complete except 0021**, which is back at `next: queue`. Eleven
of its twelve tasks closed on 2026-08-23 (0010 earlier the same day, then 0011–0020). Nothing in the
effort is blocked any more.

**0002 — the ticket graph** is phase 1 of the nested-work design (effort 0001) and is now the live effort.
Its tasks are unchanged in intent but **two of them need re-specifying against what 0009 left behind** —
see *What 0009 changed underneath 0002* below.

## The order now

1. **0022** — `claim` still parses the queue table by fixed column index, so it refuses every row on a
   newly scaffolded five-column table, silently. 0011 fixed the same defect in `next` (which now refuses
   an unparseable shape loudly rather than reporting an empty backlog) and left `claim` to this ticket. It
   is the only live regression in the shipped scaffold and ranks first: a new project cannot claim a row
   at all until it lands.
2. **0021** — at `next: queue`, not `develop`. Its AC1 (each skill at least 25% smaller) and its FR2 (no
   rule dropped) conflict on four of six files, because effort 0009 added ~20,300 bytes of AC-mandated
   content to those files before this ticket ran. Two files met the floor, four did not, and the ticket
   records the numbers and a proposed re-spec. `queue` decides which.
3. **0005, 0007, 0006, 0008** — phase 1 of the graph, in their original order, with 0006's re-spec below.
4. **0003, 0004** — later phases, blocked on 0002.

## What 0009 changed underneath 0002

Read this before picking up any of 0002's tasks.

| 0002 task | What changed | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| **0006** — rewrite `next` to parse by header name and walk ancestors | 0011 rewrote `next` entirely: five-column shape, per-stage takeable row, `--waiting`, `blocked_by` derived from the graph, and a loud refusal on an unrecognised shape | **Re-specify.** Its FR2/AC2 fixtures enumerate seven- and eight-column tables that no longer exist, so it would close green against a table nothing uses. Header-name parsing is still worth doing; the fixtures and the diff are not what the ticket describes |
| **0005** — add graph fields to the template and `QUEUE.md` | 0010 took FR3 (the header row); 0011 added `## Waiting on` to the template | Check what is left before claiming — the template already carries `next`, `status`, `expects`, `claimed_by`, `claimed_at`, `touches` and `## Waiting on` |
| **0007** — replace the Owner column with claim directories | The pared table already has no Owner column, and the token's home is the item's `claimed_by:` | The remaining scope is the `claims/<id>/` directory mechanism, not the column removal |
| **0008** — add the graph rules to `queue`, `develop`, `verify` | Those three skills were rewritten by 0013, 0018 and 0021, and `develop` already refuses a row with an open `blocked_by` | Re-read the skills first; some of this landed as a side effect |

## The collision to watch — resolved

The `0009` × `0002` file collision `RANKING.md` warned about is over. 0009 landed every file it contended
for: `templates/QUEUE.md`, `templates/item.md`, `.claude/backlog/next`, and all six `skills/*/SKILL.md`.
0002's tasks now read the shape 0009 left rather than competing with it, which is the resolution this file
proposed — *"let 0011 land and then re-specify 0006 against the shape it finds"* — and it is what the table
above records.

## Notes on tie-breakers used

- **0022 at rank 1** is tie-breaker 1, blast radius: a live regression in the shipped scaffold that blocks
  any new project from claiming a row, owned by no other ticket.
- **0021 second but not takeable at `develop`.** Its stage is `queue`, so `./next develop` steps over it
  and says why. It is not sunk to the bottom: the work is worth what it was worth, and a ticket back at
  `queue` keeps its rank (see `QUEUE.md`).
- **0009's tasks above 0002's** was an explicit owner decision on 2026-08-23, recorded so a later reader
  does not read it as drift. It is now spent — the effort is done.

## Historical — why 0009 was ordered as it was

Kept because the reasoning explains the shape of the eleven closed tickets, not because it affects the
current order.

The effort came out of a measured end-to-end run costing $15.11 over 95 turns, of which 85% was context
handling and 15% output. Gate A (the field model) went first because everything else reads or writes
`next` and `status`, so landing it late meant rewriting the same paragraphs twice. 0012 (parking findings)
came before any invocation was removed, because removing them first would have converted a measurable
saving into silent information loss. 0013 (verify closes) preceded the rest of gate B because it deleted a
rule the others would have had to work around, and a section 0020 would otherwise have compressed. 0021
went last because every other ticket rewrites the files it compresses — correct as far as it went, and the
reason it could not close is that those rewrites also *grew* them by 18%.
